He makes landscapes and I\\u2019ve often heard his name mentioned, and he got a medal in London at the same time as Rappard. He has seen my work \\u2014 those cottages I have for you, and the figure drawings too. I talked to him about the fact that to my regret I\\u2019d had trouble with , which I could hardly explain otherwise than that he\\u2019d been prattling about my work with other people from The Hague, and that since, moreover, he hadn\\u2019t seen anything in a long time, he couldn\\u2019t help got his head stuffed full there. I showed figures that thought good in the past, and at the same time those that I\\u2019m doing now, and pointed out to him how I\\u2019d changed in a few things and would change even more, but that what I was looking for now was certainly not inferior. Then he said that he didn\\u2019t doubt that Rappard would take back what he had written to me. I also showed him how, as regards the colour, I\\u2019m not predisposed to paint darkly. A couple of the cottages are actually very light. But that I\\u2019m concerned with taking the primary colours red, blue, yellow, as starting-points, as points of departure, and not grey. Then we talked quite a bit about colour, and he said among other things that he\\u2019d noticed that in old watercolours had also used brown-grey, red tones, and rather a lot in fact \\u2014 so that if one were to hold it next to one of his present drawings it would look completely red. And the same about , too. I may be doing more harm than good by telling you this, because it\\u2019s part of a conversation, and I actually ought to tell all of it. But we\\u2019ve spoken of it before, and so you may well understand it anyway, in its context. To get an coloration, to it, it\\u2019s advisable \\u2014 and particularly in this day and age, now imitators of the , grey fellows (not the masters themselves) want more and more, always and everywhere, to paint everything \\u2014 to practise in the more powerful spectrums and to persevere in using them, since the actual colourists always on the colours Thus said, for instance, that he liked the thing of the old tower, which I painted last year with a lot of bitumen in it, and thought it was beyond the paint. He said he found the whole thing original. Other old things, too, that water mill, ox-plough, avenue of autumn trees. But what pleased me most was that he thought the figures good \\u2014 he called them -like. I know for sure, though, that I\\u2019ll get them even better if I just have some luck with the expenses and can carry on working hard on them. I\\u2019m rather worried about that, though, and as for this month \\u2014 I\\u2019m broke \\u2014 I haven\\u2019t a guilder left. We\\u2019ll have a hard time \\u2014 but don\\u2019t blame me too much, for with perseverance there\\u2019s still a good chance later of reaping what we sow. I\\u2019m worried enough about your money troubles, though, I wish I could lighten them a little for you. When you come to Holland \\u2014 shouldn\\u2019t you try to approach again? Tersteeg is someone who , he\\u2019s convinced \\u2014 he\\u2019s all right. And likewise. If the fellows who in the figure were very numerous, I\\u2019d say there would be little chance of finding some help. But they\\u2019re not so very numerous \\u2014 and they\\u2019re no less necessary than in the past. It\\u2019s hard for you to keep going on your own, and I do anything to reduce the expenses \\u2014 on the contrary, I wish I could take more models. What\\u2019s to be done? One mustn\\u2019t say it\\u2019s fighting a losing battle, because others have won it, and we\\u2019ll win it too. As for , I\\u2019ve just written to tell him that I want him to retract his letter . You see, though, Theo, how it comes down to sticking to one\\u2019s guns in one\\u2019s work. I wrote to that we really do have something else to fight besides each other, and that at this moment the fellows who paint peasants and the common people must join hands, because unity is strength. One can\\u2019t do it alone, at any rate; a whole troop who agree can do more. Keep your spirits up, too, for perhaps we\\u2019ll get more friends, and then it will liven up, and the squabbling among us might perhaps become a peasant battle against the sort of painters one can still point out in all juries nowadays, who even now would try to stifle the ideas for which was the pioneer if they could. Regards \\u2014 but send me something if you can, even if it\\u2019s only ten francs, to see me through. Ever yours, Vincent\",\n          \"Dordrecht, 26 Feb. 1877 My dear Theo, The hours we spent together passed quickly, that small path behind the station where we saw the sun going down over the fields and the evening sky reflected in the ditches, and where those old moss-covered tree-trunks are standing, and the little mill in the distance \\u2013 I\\u2019ll walk there again and think of you. Herewith the photograph of \\u2018The Huguenot\\u2019; hang it up in your room. You know the story, how a young man, on the day before St Bartholomew\\u2019s Eve, was warned by his girl, who knew what would happen that night, how she wanted him to wear the sign by which Catholics were recognized, a white arm-band. He didn\\u2019t want to do it, though, his religious beliefs and his duty were dearer to him than his . Don\\u2019t know if I already sent you that poem by which I herewith copy out, it has often held a strong attraction for me, and will perhaps for you, too. Am glad that we saw \\u2019s paintings together; that evening I went to see , who lives with the lay reader of the Lutheran church in a truly old Dutch house. He has a nice room there, we sat together for a long time talking, he told me about Menton and about a Christmas he had spent there, and I told him about \\u2018The wide, wide world\\u2019, which is such a beautiful book. Thanks for coming here yesterday, and do let\\u2019s carry on having as few secrets as possible. We\\u2019re brothers, after all. Had rather a lot of work today, a great many trifling matters \\u2013 but they\\u2019re my duty \\u2013 if one had no sense of duty, who would be able to collect his thoughts at all, but a sense of duty sanctifies things and joins them together, and turns many small things into one large one. Write soon about how you got home, and whether that walk and the journey didn\\u2019t exhaust you too much. Am longing for a letter from you, also to hear whether you\\u2019ll be going to Etten. Accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Your loving brother, Vincent The night is come, but not too soon, And sinking silently All silently the little moon Drops down beneath the sky. There is no light in earth or heaven But the cold light of stars And the first watch of night is given To the red planet Mars. Is it the tender star of love The star of love and dreams Oh no! from that blue tent above A hero\\u2019s armour gleams. And earnest thoughts within me rise When I behold afar Suspended in the evening skies The shield of that red star. O star of strength I see thee stand And smile upon my pain Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand And I am strong again. Within my breast there is no light But the red light of stars I give the first watch of the night To the red planet Mars. The star of the unconquered will He rises in my breast Serene and resolute and still And calm and selfpossessed. And thou too, whosoe\\u2019er thou art That readest this brief psalm As one by one thy hopes depart Be resolute and calm. O, fear not in a world like this And thou shalt know ere long Know, how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong. . After years of city toil I hear the old church bells They sing a strange new song Whilst the old song in my memory dwells A strange new song, with strange new words That many sorrows bring And sorrowful I once again Will rejoice at what they sing. On this man will I look, saith the Lord, even on him that is poor and needy and sorrowful and that trembleth at My word. Father, we pray not that Thou shouldest take us out of the world, but that Thou shouldest deliver us from the evil. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The Lord is not far from every one of us. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it. O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. The devil is never so black that one cannot look him in the face. The same lips that spoke \\u2018be harmless as doves\\u2019 followed it immediately with \\u2018and wise as serpents\\u2019. Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me that I am meek and lowly in heart, for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. If any man hate not, even his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which seeth in secret. Anoint thine head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men, and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. We know not what we should pray, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, that our faith may not fail when our soul greatly desires to be sifted as wheat. Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying in us, Abba, Father. Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. The child puts great faith in his Father As befits the father\\u2019s worth. For who is closer than thy Father In Heaven or on earth? And He passed through the midst of them and said, Mine hour is not yet come. In the kingdom of Heaven they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. In Christ there is neither male nor female: but He is all, and in all.\",\n          \"My dear old , We\\u2019ve done a great deal of work these past few days, and in the meantime I\\u2019ve read \\u2019s Le r\\u00eave, so I\\u2019ve hardly had time to write. interests me greatly as a man \\u2014 greatly. For a long time it has seemed to me that in our filthy job as painters we have the greatest need of people with the hands and stomach of a labourer. More natural tastes \\u2014 more amorous and benevolent temperaments \\u2014 than the decadent and exhausted Parisian man-about-town. Now here, without the slightest doubt, we\\u2019re in the presence of an unspoiled creature with the instincts of a wild beast. With , blood and sex have the edge over ambition. But enough of that, you\\u2019ve seen him close at hand longer than I have, just wanted to tell you first impressions in a few words. Next, I don\\u2019t think it will astonish you greatly if I tell you that our discussions are tending to deal with the terrific subject of an association of certain painters. Ought or may this association have a commercial character, yes or no? We haven\\u2019t reached any result yet, and haven\\u2019t so much as set foot on a new continent yet. Now I, who have a presentiment of a new world, who certainly believe in the possibility of a great renaissance of art. Who believe that this new art will have the tropics for its homeland. It seems to me that we ourselves are serving only as intermediaries. And that it will only be a subsequent generation that will succeed in living in peace. Anyway, all that, our duties and our possibilities for action could become clearer to us only through actual experience. I was a little surprised not yet to have received the studies that you promised in exchange for mine. Now something that will interest you \\u2014 we\\u2019ve made some excursions in the brothels, and it\\u2019s likely that we\\u2019ll eventually go there often to work. At the moment has a canvas in progress of the same night caf\\u00e9 that I also painted, but with figures seen in the brothels. It promises to become a beautiful thing. I\\u2019ve made two studies of falling leaves in an avenue of poplars, and a third study of the whole of this avenue, entirely yellow. I declare I don\\u2019t understand why I don\\u2019t do figure studies, while theoretically it\\u2019s sometimes so difficult for me to imagine the painting of the future as anything other than a new series of powerful portraitists, simple and comprehensible to the whole of the general public. Anyway, perhaps I\\u2019ll soon get down to doing brothels. I\\u2019ll leave a page for , who will probably also write to you, and I shake your hand firmly in thought. Ever yours, Vincent the 2nd lieut. Zouaves has left for Africa, and would be very glad if you were to write to him one of these days. You will indeed do well to write him what your intentions are, so that he could take steps beforehand to prepare the way for you. , , Guelma, Africa. Don\\u2019t listen to Vincent; as you know, he\\u2019s prone to admire and ditto to be indulgent. His idea about the future of a new generation in the tropics seems absolutely right to me as a painter, and I still intend going back there when I find the funds. A little bit of luck, who knows? Vincent has done two studies of falling leaves in an avenue, which are in my room and which you would like very much. On very coarse, but very good sacking. Send news of yourself and of all the pals.

He makes landscapes and I\\u2019ve often heard his name mentioned, and he got a medal in London at the same time as Rappard. He has seen my work \\u2014 those cottages I have for you, and the figure drawings too. I talked to him about the fact that to my regret I\\u2019d had trouble with , which I could hardly explain otherwise than that he\\u2019d been prattling about my work with other people from The Hague, and that since, moreover, he hadn\\u2019t seen anything in a long time, he couldn\\u2019t help got his head stuffed full there. I showed figures that thought good in the past, and at the same time those that I\\u2019m doing now, and pointed out to him how I\\u2019d changed in a few things and would change even more, but that what I was looking for now was certainly not inferior. Then he said that he didn\\u2019t doubt that Rappard would take back what he had written to me. I also showed him how, as regards the colour, I\\u2019m not predisposed to paint darkly. A couple of the cottages are actually very light. But that I\\u2019m concerned with taking the primary colours red, blue, yellow, as starting-points, as points of departure, and not grey. Then we talked quite a bit about colour, and he said among other things that he\\u2019d noticed that in old watercolours had also used brown-grey, red tones, and rather a lot in fact \\u2014 so that if one were to hold it next to one of his present drawings it would look completely red. And the same about , too. I may be doing more harm than good by telling you this, because it\\u2019s part of a conversation, and I actually ought to tell all of it. But we\\u2019ve spoken of it before, and so you may well understand it anyway, in its context. To get an coloration, to it, it\\u2019s advisable \\u2014 and particularly in this day and age, now imitators of the , grey fellows (not the masters themselves) want more and more, always and everywhere, to paint everything \\u2014 to practise in the more powerful spectrums and to persevere in using them, since the actual colourists always on the colours Thus said, for instance, that he liked the thing of the old tower, which I painted last year with a lot of bitumen in it, and thought it was beyond the paint. He said he found the whole thing original. Other old things, too, that water mill, ox-plough, avenue of autumn trees. But what pleased me most was that he thought the figures good \\u2014 he called them -like. I know for sure, though, that I\\u2019ll get them even better if I just have some luck with the expenses and can carry on working hard on them. I\\u2019m rather worried about that, though, and as for this month \\u2014 I\\u2019m broke \\u2014 I haven\\u2019t a guilder left. We\\u2019ll have a hard time \\u2014 but don\\u2019t blame me too much, for with perseverance there\\u2019s still a good chance later of reaping what we sow. I\\u2019m worried enough about your money troubles, though, I wish I could lighten them a little for you. When you come to Holland \\u2014 shouldn\\u2019t you try to approach again? Tersteeg is someone who , he\\u2019s convinced \\u2014 he\\u2019s all right. And likewise. If the fellows who in the figure were very numerous, I\\u2019d say there would be little chance of finding some help. But they\\u2019re not so very numerous \\u2014 and they\\u2019re no less necessary than in the past. It\\u2019s hard for you to keep going on your own, and I do anything to reduce the expenses \\u2014 on the contrary, I wish I could take more models. What\\u2019s to be done? One mustn\\u2019t say it\\u2019s fighting a losing battle, because others have won it, and we\\u2019ll win it too. As for , I\\u2019ve just written to tell him that I want him to retract his letter . You see, though, Theo, how it comes down to sticking to one\\u2019s guns in one\\u2019s work. I wrote to that we really do have something else to fight besides each other, and that at this moment the fellows who paint peasants and the common people must join hands, because unity is strength. One can\\u2019t do it alone, at any rate; a whole troop who agree can do more. Keep your spirits up, too, for perhaps we\\u2019ll get more friends, and then it will liven up, and the squabbling among us might perhaps become a peasant battle against the sort of painters one can still point out in all juries nowadays, who even now would try to stifle the ideas for which was the pioneer if they could. Regards \\u2014 but send me something if you can, even if it\\u2019s only ten francs, to see me through. Ever yours, Vincent\",\n          \"Dordrecht, 26 Feb. 1877 My dear Theo, The hours we spent together passed quickly, that small path behind the station where we saw the sun going down over the fields and the evening sky reflected in the ditches, and where those old moss-covered tree-trunks are standing, and the little mill in the distance \\u2013 I\\u2019ll walk there again and think of you. Herewith the photograph of \\u2018The Huguenot\\u2019; hang it up in your room. You know the story, how a young man, on the day before St Bartholomew\\u2019s Eve, was warned by his girl, who knew what would happen that night, how she wanted him to wear the sign by which Catholics were recognized, a white arm-band. He didn\\u2019t want to do it, though, his religious beliefs and his duty were dearer to him than his . Don\\u2019t know if I already sent you that poem by which I herewith copy out, it has often held a strong attraction for me, and will perhaps for you, too. Am glad that we saw \\u2019s paintings together; that evening I went to see , who lives with the lay reader of the Lutheran church in a truly old Dutch house. He has a nice room there, we sat together for a long time talking, he told me about Menton and about a Christmas he had spent there, and I told him about \\u2018The wide, wide world\\u2019, which is such a beautiful book. Thanks for coming here yesterday, and do let\\u2019s carry on having as few secrets as possible. We\\u2019re brothers, after all. Had rather a lot of work today, a great many trifling matters \\u2013 but they\\u2019re my duty \\u2013 if one had no sense of duty, who would be able to collect his thoughts at all, but a sense of duty sanctifies things and joins them together, and turns many small things into one large one. Write soon about how you got home, and whether that walk and the journey didn\\u2019t exhaust you too much. Am longing for a letter from you, also to hear whether you\\u2019ll be going to Etten. Accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Your loving brother, Vincent The night is come, but not too soon, And sinking silently All silently the little moon Drops down beneath the sky. There is no light in earth or heaven But the cold light of stars And the first watch of night is given To the red planet Mars. Is it the tender star of love The star of love and dreams Oh no! from that blue tent above A hero\\u2019s armour gleams. And earnest thoughts within me rise When I behold afar Suspended in the evening skies The shield of that red star. O star of strength I see thee stand And smile upon my pain Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand And I am strong again. Within my breast there is no light But the red light of stars I give the first watch of the night To the red planet Mars. The star of the unconquered will He rises in my breast Serene and resolute and still And calm and selfpossessed. And thou too, whosoe\\u2019er thou art That readest this brief psalm As one by one thy hopes depart Be resolute and calm. O, fear not in a world like this And thou shalt know ere long Know, how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong. . After years of city toil I hear the old church bells They sing a strange new song Whilst the old song in my memory dwells A strange new song, with strange new words That many sorrows bring And sorrowful I once again Will rejoice at what they sing. On this man will I look, saith the Lord, even on him that is poor and needy and sorrowful and that trembleth at My word. Father, we pray not that Thou shouldest take us out of the world, but that Thou shouldest deliver us from the evil. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The Lord is not far from every one of us. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it. O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. The devil is never so black that one cannot look him in the face. The same lips that spoke \\u2018be harmless as doves\\u2019 followed it immediately with \\u2018and wise as serpents\\u2019. Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me that I am meek and lowly in heart, for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. If any man hate not, even his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which seeth in secret. Anoint thine head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men, and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. We know not what we should pray, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, that our faith may not fail when our soul greatly desires to be sifted as wheat. Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying in us, Abba, Father. Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. The child puts great faith in his Father As befits the father\\u2019s worth. For who is closer than thy Father In Heaven or on earth? And He passed through the midst of them and said, Mine hour is not yet come. In the kingdom of Heaven they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. In Christ there is neither male nor female: but He is all, and in all.\",\n          \"My dear old , We\\u2019ve done a great deal of work these past few days, and in the meantime I\\u2019ve read \\u2019s Le r\\u00eave, so I\\u2019ve hardly had time to write. interests me greatly as a man \\u2014 greatly. For a long time it has seemed to me that in our filthy job as painters we have the greatest need of people with the hands and stomach of a labourer. More natural tastes \\u2014 more amorous and benevolent temperaments \\u2014 than the decadent and exhausted Parisian man-about-town. Now here, without the slightest doubt, we\\u2019re in the presence of an unspoiled creature with the instincts of a wild beast. With , blood and sex have the edge over ambition. But enough of that, you\\u2019ve seen him close at hand longer than I have, just wanted to tell you first impressions in a few words. Next, I don\\u2019t think it will astonish you greatly if I tell you that our discussions are tending to deal with the terrific subject of an association of certain painters. Ought or may this association have a commercial character, yes or no? We haven\\u2019t reached any result yet, and haven\\u2019t so much as set foot on a new continent yet. Now I, who have a presentiment of a new world, who certainly believe in the possibility of a great renaissance of art. Who believe that this new art will have the tropics for its homeland. It seems to me that we ourselves are serving only as intermediaries. And that it will only be a subsequent generation that will succeed in living in peace. Anyway, all that, our duties and our possibilities for action could become clearer to us only through actual experience. I was a little surprised not yet to have received the studies that you promised in exchange for mine. Now something that will interest you \\u2014 we\\u2019ve made some excursions in the brothels, and it\\u2019s likely that we\\u2019ll eventually go there often to work. At the moment has a canvas in progress of the same night caf\\u00e9 that I also painted, but with figures seen in the brothels. It promises to become a beautiful thing. I\\u2019ve made two studies of falling leaves in an avenue of poplars, and a third study of the whole of this avenue, entirely yellow. I declare I don\\u2019t understand why I don\\u2019t do figure studies, while theoretically it\\u2019s sometimes so difficult for me to imagine the painting of the future as anything other than a new series of powerful portraitists, simple and comprehensible to the whole of the general public. Anyway, perhaps I\\u2019ll soon get down to doing brothels. I\\u2019ll leave a page for , who will probably also write to you, and I shake your hand firmly in thought. Ever yours, Vincent the 2nd lieut. Zouaves has left for Africa, and would be very glad if you were to write to him one of these days. You will indeed do well to write him what your intentions are, so that he could take steps beforehand to prepare the way for you. , , Guelma, Africa. Don\\u2019t listen to Vincent; as you know, he\\u2019s prone to admire and ditto to be indulgent. His idea about the future of a new generation in the tropics seems absolutely right to me as a painter, and I still intend going back there when I find the funds. A little bit of luck, who knows? Vincent has done two studies of falling leaves in an avenue, which are in my room and which you would like very much. On very coarse, but very good sacking. Send news of yourself and of all the pals.

            "Cuesmes, 20 August 1880 Dear Theo, If I’m not mistaken, you should still have ’s ‘The labours of the fields’. Would you be so kind as to lend them to me for a short while, and to send them to me by post? You should know that I’m sketching large drawings after , and that I’ve done The four times of the day, as well as The sower. Well, if you saw them perhaps you wouldn’t be too unhappy with them. Now, if you’d like to send me The labours of the fields, perhaps you could also add some other sheets by or after , , , &c. Don’t buy any specially, but lend me what you may have. Send me what you can, and don’t have any fears on my account. If only I can go on working, I’ll recover somehow. But you’d be a great help to me by doing this. If you pay a visit to Holland sooner or later, I hope you won’t pass by without coming to see the scratches. I’m writing to you while drawing and I’m in a hurry to get back to it, so good-night, and send the sheets as soon as possible, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent c/o rue du Pavillon 3 . The s that I’ve done are The four times of the day, the format more or less that of a sheet from the drawing course. You’ll understand well enough yourself what I need to make it unnecessary for me to tell you,but I’ll tell you nevertheless, so that you can know my thinking. They’re mainly figure studies, such as ’s The diggers, or the lithograph after his Winnower. And figures by or or or . I believe you could find just what I need at the Alliance des Arts, where they have the lithographs by Contemporary Artists &c., which are sold there extremely cheaply. A sheet that I’d be immensely glad to have is ’s large etching after , The bush, which is on sale at the print-shop in the Louvre. I’ve done a scratch of miners, male and female thrutchers, going to the pit in the morning, in the snow, on a path beside a thorn-hedge: passing shadows, dimly visible in the dusk. In the background, the large mine buildings and the slag heap are becoming indistinct against the sky. I’m sending you the croquis so that you can picture it for yourself. But I feel the need to study figure drawing from masters like , and or , or someone else. What do you think of the croquis? Does the idea seem good to you? In the photographs after by there is, if I remember rightly, one of women gleaners. Dark silhouettes against a sky in which the sun is setting, red. There you are, it’s things like that I need to have before my eyes. It’s because I think you’d prefer to see me doing something good than doing nothing at all that I’m writing to you on this subject, and perhaps it would be a reason why good understanding and friendship might be re-established between the two of us, and we might perhaps be useful to one another. I’d very much like to execute the drawing in question better than I have done. In the one that I’ve done, as it stands, the figures might be about 10 centimetres high. The pendant is of the miners’ return, but it’s less successful as it stands. It’s very difficult, as it involves an effect of brown silhouettes encircled by light against a streaky sunset sky. Send by return of post if you can and if you will. I’ve dropped a line to to ask him if perhaps there would be some way for me to have ’s for a while, i.e. the studies of the nude model you’re familiar with. I don’t know if he’ll do it or not, that’s to say send me them, but supposing he didn’t, couldn’t you influence him a little in my favour? Because these Exercices au fusain would be eminently useful to me. But perhaps he’ll do me the favour of sending me at least some sheets, if not the whole course.\n"

            "Welwyn, 17 June 1876 My dear Theo, Last Monday I left Ramsgate for London. That’s a long walk indeed, and when I left it was awfully hot and it remained so until the evening, when I arrived at Canterbury. That same evening I walked a bit further until I came to a couple of large beeches and elms next to a small pond, where I rested for a while. In the morning at half past 3 the birds began to sing upon seeing the morning twilight, and I continued on my way. It was good to walk then. In the afternoon I arrived at Chatham, where, in the distance, past partly flooded, low-lying meadows, with elms here and there, one sees the Thames full of ships. It’s always grey weather there, I think. There I met a cart that brought me a couple of miles further, but then the driver went into an inn and I thought he might stay there a long time, so I walked on and arrived towards evening in the well-known suburbs of London and walked on towards the city down the long, long ‘Roads’. I stayed in London for two days and often ran from one end of the city to the other in order to see various people, including a to whom I’d written. Herewith a translation of the letter, I’m sending it to you because you should know that the feeling I have as I start out is ‘Father, I am not worthy!’ and ‘Father be merciful to me!’ Should I find anything it will probably be a situation somewhere between minister and missionary, in the suburbs of London among working folk. Don’t speak about this to anyone, Theo. My salary at ’s will be very small. Probably only board and lodging and some free time in which to teach, or if there’s no free time, at most 20 pounds a year. But to continue: I spent one night at ’s and the next at ’s, where they were very, very kind. Mr Gladwell kissed me good-night and that did me good, may it be granted me sometime in the future to show some more friendship to his every now and then. I wanted to leave for Welwyn that evening, but they literally held me back by force because of the pouring rain. However, when it had let up somewhat, around 4 in the morning, I set out for Welwyn. First a long walk from one end of the city to the other, something like 10 miles (each taking 20 minutes). In the afternoon at 5, I was with our and was very glad to see her. She looks well and you would be as pleased with her room as I am, with ‘Good Friday’, ‘Christ in the Garden of Olives’, ‘Mater Dolorosa’ &c. with ivy around them instead of frames. Old boy, when you read my letter to that minister you’ll perhaps say: he’s not so bad after all, though in fact he is. Think of him as he is, however, every once in a while. A handshake in thought from Your loving brother Vincent Rev. Sir. A clergyman’s son, who, because he must work to earn a living, has no money and no time to study at King’s College, and who, besides that, is already a couple of years older than is usual for someone starting there, and has not even begun on the preparatory studies of Latin and Greek, would, in spite of everything, dearly like to find a situation connected with the church, even though the position of a clergyman who has had college training is beyond his reach. My is a clergyman in a village in Holland. When I was 11 years old I started going to school and stayed there until I was 16. At that time I had to choose a profession and didn’t know what to choose. Through the offices of one of my s, an associate in the firm of Goupil & Co., art dealers and publishers of engravings, I was given a position in his branch at The Hague. I worked for the firm for 3 years. From there I went to London to learn English, and after 2 years from there to Paris. Forced by various circumstances to quit the firm, however, I left Messrs G.&Co. and have since taught for 2 months at ’s school at Ramsgate. As my goal is a situation connected with the church, however, I must look further. Although I have not been trained for the church, perhaps my past life of travelling, living in various countries, associating with a variety of people, rich and poor, religious and not religious, working at a variety of jobs, days of manual labour in between days of office work &c., perhaps also my speaking various languages, will compensate in part for my lack of formal training. But what I should prefer to give as my reason for commending myself to you is my innate love of the church and that which concerns the church, which has at times lain dormant, though it awakened repeatedly, and – if I may say so, despite feelings of great inadequacy and shortcoming – the Love of God and of humankind. And also, when I think of my past life and of my ’s house in that Dutch village, a feeling of ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants. Be merciful to me.’ When I was living in London I often attended your church and I have not forgotten you. Now I am asking you for a recommendation in my search for a situation, and to keep a fatherly eye on me should I find such a situation. I have been left very much to myself; I believe that your fatherly eye could do me good, now that The early dew of morning has passed away at noon. Thanking you in advance for whatever you may be willing to do for me...\n"

            "My dear Theo, I’ve just sent off 3 large drawings, as well as some other, smaller ones and the two lithographs by . The vertical small farmhouse garden is, it seems to me, the best of the three large ones. The one with the sunflowers is the little garden of a bathhouse. The third, horizontal, garden is the one of which I’ve also done some painted studies. Under the blue sky, the orange, yellow, red patches of flowers take on an amazing brilliance, and in the limpid air there’s something happier and more suggestive of love than in the north. It vibrates — like the bouquet by that you have. I’m annoyed with myself for not painting flowers here. Anyway, even having already produced about fifty drawings or painted studies here, I feel as though I’ve done absolutely nothing at all. I’d gladly content myself with being nothing but a pioneer for other, future painters who’ll come to work in the south. Now the harvest, the garden, the sower and the two seascapes are croquis after painted studies. I believe that all these ideas are good, but the painted studies lack clarity of touch. One more reason why I felt the need to draw them. I wanted to paint a little old peasant who had an enormous resemblance to our in his features. Only he was more common, and verged on caricature. Nevertheless, I would have been enormously keen to do him just as he was as a little peasant. He promised to come, and then he said that he ought to have the painting for himself, and so I had to do two the same, one for him and one for me. I told him no. Perhaps he’ll come back some day. I’m curious to know if you knew the s. At the moment there are still plenty of fine lithographs to be had, s, reproductions of , , , , , &c. Soon, though, it’ll be over, and what a great pity that this art tends to disappear. Why is it that we don’t hold on to what we have, the way doctors and mechanics do? Once something has been discovered and found, they keep the knowledge of it; in these wretched fine arts we forget everything, we hold on to nothing. gave us the essence of the peasant, and now, yes, there’s , it’s true there are one or two more, .... and have we now more generally learned how to see peasants — , hardly anyone knows how to polish one off. Isn’t it partly the fault of Paris and the Parisians, fickle and disloyal like the sea? Well then, you’re damned right to say, let’s go quietly on our way, working for ourselves. You know, whatever becomes of sacrosanct Impressionism, I’d still myself have the wish to do the things that the generation, , , , , , , , , , , , , a heap of others, , ... could understand. Ah, was really really close to it, and , to marrying form and colour. Me, I’d be quite happy to stay silent for 10 years doing nothing but studies, then do one or two figure paintings. The old plan, so often recommended and so rarely carried out. If the drawings that I send you are too stiff, it’s because I did them in such a way as to be able later, if they’re still there, to use them as information for painting. This vertical small farmhouse garden is superbly coloured in reality. The dahlias are a rich and dark purple, the double row of flowers is on one side almost without greenery on the other. In the middle a low, white dahlia and a little pomegranate tree, with flowers of the most brilliant orange red, yellow-green fruit, the ground grey, the tall reeds — ‘canes’ — of a blue green, the fig trees emerald, the sky blue, the houses white with green windows, red roofs. In full sun in the morning, in the evening entirely bathed in shadow cast by the fig trees and reeds. If was there, or .... What can you say, to encompass everything you’d need an entire school of people working together in the same area, complementing each other like the old Dutch: portrait painters, genre painters, landscape painters, painters of animals, still-life painters. Must also tell you that I made a very interesting tour round the farms with someone who knows the area. But you know that in the real Provence it’s more often small peasant farming à la than anything else. and don’t understand much of it, or rather, nothing. Now if I myself am beginning to see it a bit more clearly, I’d need a good long stay to do it. At times it nevertheless seems likely to me that I’ll have to make the journey myself if doesn’t manage to sort out the mess he’s in, if we want to put the plan into practice. And then so be it, I’m still among peasants anyway, it’s the same. It’s even my opinion that we should try to keep ourselves ready to go to him, because I believe that he could soon be in terrible straits again if, for example, his landlord won’t give him any more credit. That’s so predictable, and his distress could be so great that it might be urgent to put the partnership into practice. For me there’s only the one-way journey, and the prices over there that he has mentioned are in any case considerably lower than what one inevitably spends here. I’m counting on having your letter on Saturday morning. I’ve bought two more canvases, so I now have just 5 francs left, and it’s already Wednesday evening. Here, in days with no money, there’s just one more advantage over the north, the fine weather (because even the mistral is fine weather to ). Really glorious sunshine, in which dried himself off while drinking his coffee. You can’t help feeling and everywhere. It’s so full of life! In the style of , in the style of . There would certainly be the possibility of a school of painting here. But you’ll say that nature is beautiful everywhere if one goes into it deeply enough. Have you read Madame Chrysanthème yet, have you made the acquaintance of that pimp ‘of a surprising courtesy’, Monsieur Kangourou? And of the sugared peppers, the fried ices and the salted sweets? I’ve been very, very well these last few days; in the long run I believe that I’ll belong to these parts in all respects. In the peasant’s garden I saw the figure of a woman carved in wood, originally from the prow of a Spanish ship. It was in a grove of cypresses, and it was pure . Ah, these farmhouse gardens with the lovely big red Provence roses, the vines, the fig trees; it’s quite poetic, and the eternal strong sun, in spite of which the foliage stays very green. The tank, out of which clear water flows that irrigates the farm through channels forming a little canal system. An old, pure white Camargue horse drives the machinery. No cows on these little farms. My and his (grocers) strongly resemble the Buteaux, for example. But here, farmhouse and cheap grog-shops are less gloomy, less tragic than in the north, because the heat &c. makes poverty less hard and melancholy. I’d so much like you to have seen this part of the country. Well, first we’ll have to see how the business turns out. I haven’t told you yet that I’ve had a letter from ; I wrote to him a week ago. I can easily see him coming back sometime. Is still there? I’d be quite surprised if that book by was no longer in existence. They’d certainly know it at ’s or at the artists’ colourman in Chaussée d’Antin. Or know where it is. If I should ever happen to give drawing lessons, or have to talk with painters about the of technique, I’ll have to have it to hand. It’s THE ONLY genuinely practical book that I know, and I know a little from experience how useful it is. , , even , of them would need it, and how many others. Macknight keeps coming. I’ve worked again on a figure of a Zouave, sitting on a bench against a white wall, which makes the fifth figure. This morning I was at a washing-place with figures of women as broad as ’s negresses. One in particular, in white-black-pink. Another all yellow; there were a good thirty of them, young and old. I hope to send you still more croquis of painted studies. Hoping to have news from you soon. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent\n"
